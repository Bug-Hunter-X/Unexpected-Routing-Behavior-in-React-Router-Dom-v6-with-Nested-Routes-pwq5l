# Unexpected Routing Behavior in React Router Dom v6 with Nested Routes

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using nested routes or route parameters within React Router Dom v6.  The issue manifests as unexpected rendering behavior or routing errors under specific conditions, particularly when certain routes are combined or a route is added or removed.  The bug is characterized by incorrect component rendering, failure to navigate to the expected route, or other unexpected routing behavior.

## Problem Description

The core issue lies in the interaction between nested routes and route parameters within the React Router DOM V6.  Adding or removing certain routes, or changing the nesting hierarchy, can trigger this unpredictable behavior.   This seems especially likely to happen when dealing with routes that have similar paths or when dynamic segments are involved.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the routing behavior by navigating between the Home, About, and Contact pages.  You may encounter inconsistent rendering, navigation errors, or other unexpected outcomes.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file and involves careful examination and adjustment of the routing configuration, particularly concerning path definitions, parameter handling, and potential conflicts between routes.
